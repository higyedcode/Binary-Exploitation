# Binary-Exploitation
My Binary Exploitation materials, notes, and training exercises.
This repository includes general binary exploitation notes(in the notes folder), a guide used for learning these concepts, gathered from educational sources and from personal research during CTFs that I keep on updating when learning new methods. The rest of the materials are pwn challenges from different CTFs like the DCTF qualifiers.
